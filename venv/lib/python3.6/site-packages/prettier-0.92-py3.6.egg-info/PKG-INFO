Description: ================
        A prettier print
        ================
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        Python's standard pretty print library (pprint) doesn't support user defined class.
        Once I wanted to print Python's AST prettier, however it's not possible to use "pprint" for the purpose.
        
        
        
        What is it?
        ===========
        
        This library is an implementation in Python of "A prettier print" introduced by Philip Wadler.
        
        http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf
        
        The algorithm was also implemented in Ruby's standard library: prettyprint.rb.
        
        http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/prettyprint/rdoc/classes/PrettyPrint.html
        
        
        
        Example
        =======
        
        The purpose of this library is to give *prettyprint* ability on your class. 
        In examples/show_ast.py you can see such examples. Here are small samples.
        
        ::
        
          >>> from prettier import *
          >>> docs = [Text("1. abc"), Text("2. abc"), Text("3. abc")]
        
          # fill given space 
          >>> print(pretty(40, fill(docs)))
          1. abc 2. abc 3. abc
          
          >>> print(pretty(13, fill(docs)))
          1. abc 2. abc
          3. abc
          
          >>> print(pretty(8, fill(docs)))
          1. abc
          2. abc
          3. abc
        
          # horizontal only
          >>> print(pretty(1, spread(docs))) 
          1. abc 2. abc 3. abc
          
          # vertical only
          >>> print(pretty(100, stack(docs))) 
          1. abc
          2. abc
          3. abc
          
          # when there isn't enough space to put horizontal, put vertical
          >>> print(pretty(20, stack_or_spread(docs)))
          1. abc 2. abc 3. abc
          
          >>> print(pretty(13, stack_or_spread(docs)))
          1. abc
          2. abc
          3. abc
          
          # when there isn't enough space to put horizontal, use indent
          >>> print(pretty(10, can_break_with_nest(docs)))
          1. abc
            2. abc
            3. abc
          
          
        Setup
        =====

          $ easy_install prettier
        
        
        
        Usage

        Read the doctest please.
        
        
        
        History
        =======
        
        0.92 (2010-09-02)
        -----------------
        
        - Relative file("README.rst") fail on PyPI server. Fixed the bug in setup.py.
        - Because I didn't write MANIFEST.in, README.rst wasn't included in source distribution. Add it.
        - PEP8 discouraged underscores in module name. Renamed it.
        
        0.91 (2010-09-02)
        -----------------
        
        - Because I did `$ python setup.py sdist bdist bdist_egg upload`, there comes `"dumb" binary`. Removed `bdist`.
        
        
        0.9 (2010-09-02)
        ----------------
        
        - first release
        
        
        
        Roadmap
        =======
        
        - Make a function `pprint(obj)` which work like standard `pprint.pprint`
        
        When the goal is achived the version goes 1.0.
        
        For developer(include me)
        =========================
        
        Here is the repository: https://bitbucket.org/nishio/prettierprint
        
        
        Don't forget to run test and confirm tests cover all code:
        
          $ coverage run prettier/__init__.py && coverage html
        
        Don't forget to test README.rst is valid:
        
          $ rst2html.py README.rst > README.html
        
        When you relaese new version, don't put `bdist` option.:
        
          $ python setup.py sdist bdist_egg upload
        
        Lisence
        =======
        
        Same as Python 3.0.
